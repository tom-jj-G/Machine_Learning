# Machine_Learning

## Objectives
The goals of this challenge is to:

- Implement machine learning models
- Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models to predict credit risk.

## Technoligies
- Python (version 3.7.7)

## Resources

- Dataset: cf. *LoanStats_2019Q1.csv* in [Resources](/Resources) folder
- Notebook: cf. *credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb* and *credit_risk_resampling.ipynb* files

### Analysis

Based on the balanced accuracy, *EasyEnsembleClassifier* model, with an accuracy of about 90%, outperforms the others five models which are all about 70% of accuracy (except the *ClusterCentroids* which is the less accurate with a 50% mark).
In overall, based on our dataset, all models have quite a perfect precision for predicting low risk credit (about 100%!) but have a really bad precision to predict high risk credit. *EasyEnsembleClassifier* model also outperforms other models but its precision is limited to about 9% which could lead to a lot of false positives (loans detected as high risk whereas they present low risk).
Regarding sensitivity, again, the *EasyEnsembleClassifier* model shows the best results as it correctly caught about 92% of high risk loans and about 94% of low risk ones.
Thus, our objective would mainly be to build/find a model that find the maximum of high risk loans. In that way, *EasyEnsembleClassifier* model could be a could solution but it presents an important flaw which could be problematic: this model would pop-up a lot of loans as high risk ones whereas they present low risk which could lead to a lot of additional work for end-user.

#### Recommendation

**Even if the *EasyEnsembleClassifier* model ends up with having the best overall results, we would recommend to perform additional tasks:**
- **Deleted some "parasite" features in our dataset which present the lower impact on this model in order to strengthen it**
- **If the modelâ€™s precision regarding high risk is significant higher and the precision is acceptable/manageable for end-user:**
    - > ***EasyEnsembleClassifier* model should be picked**
- **If one of the two conditions above is not fulfilled:**
    - > **another model must be found**
